This is a repo for a couple of lectures on stationary stochastic processes that I have given at Stockholm University.

### Contents

* Intro to stationary stochastic processes
* Correlation properties
* Spectral properties
* Mean square convergence
* Spectral representation of stationary stochastic processes

---

### Course literature and Schedule

The lectures will be based on parts of the following books:

* Lindgren, G. Rootzén, H. and Sandsten, M. (2014). Stationary Stochastic Processes for Scientist and Engineers, CRC Press. (abbreviated LRS)
* Lindgren, G. (2014). Stationary Stochastic Processes, CRC Press. (abbreviated LAdv)
